# Druid test

Testing the [Druid GUI library](https://github.com/linebender/runebender) for
rust

## Pro
* has a ['Book'](https://linebender.org/druid/)
* Good set of [goals](https://github.com/linebender/druid#Goals) for the library
* Easily cross-platform (Windows, Linux, Mac, Web)

## Con
* Book is unfinished, quite barebones
* Subjectively complicated API
* Development of the library, at the time of writing seems rather slow

## Conclusion
It's not ready yet. To be fair to Druid, they don't claim it's ready and call it
an 'experiment'. It seems possible to build a decent application with it, but
nothing that is actually production ready.
